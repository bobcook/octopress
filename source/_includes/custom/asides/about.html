  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I started my first business as Apple Computer dealer #145 in 1978.  That was 6 months before Apple introduced the 5.25 inch floppy disk drive.</p>
  <p>In 1983 I started Sun Remarketing and over the next 20 years we sold over $100 million in used Macintosh Computers.  My first website for Sun Remarketing was in 1997, and I have created websites ever sense.</p>
